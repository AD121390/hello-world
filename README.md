hello-world Github tutorial

Hi! My name is Adriel Domingo

This whole Github thing is very new to me, but I am very excited to learn about it and all of the vocabularry and "slang" that comes with it. It seems like Github is becoming the main platform for project repositories. This will be a great learning experinece and will probably come in handy in my profesional and academic career. 

Short biography:
I currently live in the Binghamton, NY area. I did my undergrad in Computer Engineering, so I have a little bit of programming experience, but I wanted to strengthen my programming abilities which is why I am taking the Software Development MS program at Boston University. The programming languages that I know are C/C++, Python and Matlab. I currently work at Lockheed Martin as a Test Engineer but I am hoping to transfer into a Electronics Engineer position in the somewhat near future.
